# Polymer Framework Interoperability

Have you tried using Polymer with another framework and had issues?
Let's fix them!

The goal of this project is to figure out how to make Polymer play nice with
other popular developer tools. Because Polymer is based on Web Component
standards, _in theory_, things should "just work" but whether it be from
polyfill quirks or timing mishaps, reality sometimes proves otherwise.

## Tell Us Where Things Break

Not being an expert in every framework or library I need the community's help
to figure out where things don't quite line up. So if you're interested please:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/robdodson/polymer-framework-interop/issues)
2. Provide a reduced test case (ideally a [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/))
3. Help us work through the problem :)

## Examples

As we get more test cases to work through we can build and share examples here
that demonstrate how to more effectively combine Polymer and other
frameworks/libraries.
